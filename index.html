        <h2> Sicilian Food</h2>
        <p> The culinary treasures of Sicilian cuisine are truly endless. 
            I could spend hours talking about the iconic and most famous dishes of the beautiful Island
            such as sfincione, panrlle and fried everything. But today, I dusted off grandma's old cookbook and, 
            thanks to her formidable advice, I prepared three diffrent pasta recipies: 
            <a href="anellini.html"> <i> Anellini col forno</i> </a>,
                 <a href="pastamuddica.html"> <i> Pasta ca muddica atturrata </i> </a> , 
                 <a href="pastanorma.html"> <i> Pasta alla Norma </i> </a> .
                 <br>

            Each person preserves their own family recipe, suggesting which ingredients have been passed down for generations. 
            As we savor this flavors, let the essence of Sicilian cuisine linger, 
            creating lasting memories and a connection to a culinary heritage that spans generations. Buon Appetito! <br> - Silvia </p>
