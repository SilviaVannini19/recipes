    <ul> 
        <li> Ribbed Tomatoes 1.5 kg </li>
        <li> 4 cloves of garlic </li>
        <li> Fine Salt, to taste </li>
        <li> 1 bunch of basil </li>
        
        </ul>

        <p> <i> for frying </i> </p>

            </ul>

        <h3> Preparation </h3>
       <ol> 
        <li> To prepare Pasta alla Norma, first, 
            wash and thoroughly dry the eggplant, then trim it. 
            Slice it into approximately 8 mm thick rounds and place them in a colander.
             Sprinkle them with salt and let them drain for at least 15 minutes. </li>


            <li>  Meanwhile, attend to the tomatoes: wash them, removing the stems. 
                Cut them in half. Transfer the tomatoes to a saucepan with a pinch of salt, 
                3 cloves of garlic (you can reduce if preferred, but it characterizes Pasta alla Norma), 
                and a bunch of basil. Let them cook for 30 minutes over low heat without adding 
                anything; the tomatoes will release their juices. After 30 minutes, 
                remove garlic and basil. Transfer the tomatoes to a fine-mesh sieve and strain. </li> 


                <li> Once you have obtained your tomato puree, transfer it to a pan, 
                    add another clove of garlic and a sprig of basil.
                     Let it cook for another 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. </li>


                    <li> You can rinse the eggplants well, pat them dry with kitchen paper. 
                        Then, pour extra virgin olive oil into a high-sided pot and heat it
                        to a temperature of about 170-180Â°C. 
                        Immerse a few eggplants at a time in the oil, turning them occasionally.
                        It will take a few minutes for them to become golden brown. 
                        Drain them with tongs and transfer them to a tray lined with kitchen paper.
                        Continue frying the eggplants and meanwhile, put a pot of water on the stove for boiling the pasta. 
                        When the sauce is quite thick, remove the basil, 
                        add a tablespoon of the frying oil from the eggplants and a drizzle of raw oil. </li>


                        <li> Cook the pasta al dente, drain it, and transfer it to the sauce. Toss quickly to coat. </li>


                        <li> Plate the pasta, add the fried eggplants, 
                            plenty of grated salted sheep's ricotta, a basil leaf, 
                            and serve your Pasta alla Norma! </li>
