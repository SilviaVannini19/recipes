        </ul>

        <h3> Preparation </h3>
       <ol> 
        <li>  To prepare baked Anelletti, start by peeling and chopping the red onion. 
            Then, move to the stove and sauté it in a pan with some olive oil for 2-3 minutes over low heat.
            Add the meats: first, the beef and then the pork; break them apart with a wooden spoon while letting them brown for about ten minutes.
            After this time, deglaze with red wine, and after a couple of minutes, once the alcohol has completely evaporated, you can also add the tomato concentrate and lower the heat.
            Dissolve it well, then add water. Give it another stir and continue cooking for another 30 minutes, keeping the heat low and stirring occasionally. </li>
           
            <li> Later, add the peas (fresh or frozen) and cook for another 20 minutes,
                so add a little water as needed and stir occasionally until the sauce is well reduced.
                Finally, add a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper to taste. </li> 
               

                <li> While the sauce is cooking, put a pot of water on the heat to boil and salt it: it will be used for cooking the Anelletti. 
                    Then, prepare the baking dish: grease it with a bit of oil and distribute it carefully over the entire surface of a 30x20 baking dish. 
                    Then sprinkle with breadcrumbs and shake the baking dish to make the crumbs adhere well. Move on to the cheeses, grate the Caciocavallo and cube the fresh Pecorino. </li>
            

                    <li> 
                        Set everything aside and focus on the pasta: cook the Anelletti in boiling water, draining them 2-3 minutes before the end of cooking. 
                        Plunge them directly into the pan with the now-ready sauce: but first, make sure the seasoning is right, adding a pinch more if needed.
                        At this point, mix and then add the grated Caciocavallo, reserving some for the surface, then the cubed fresh Pecorino 
                        and a pinch of black pepper to your taste. Mix again and start filling the baking dish, using a ladle. </li>

                        <li> Level the surface to distribute everything evenly and sprinkle with the remaining Caciocavallo and then breadcrumbs.
                            Finally, bake in a preheated static oven at 180°C for about 40 minutes. 
                            Before unmolding, wait for 5 minutes; this way, your baked Anelletti will stay perfectly shaped when served! </li>
